Nawiri
Nawiri is a loan management platform designed to help lenders manage their loan portfolios more efficiently. The platform allows lenders to easily create and manage loan products, track borrower information and loan balances, and process and track loan payments.

Business Case
The lending industry in many developing countries is highly fragmented and often lacks efficient and effective tools for managing loan portfolios. Many lenders still rely on manual processes and paper-based records, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Nawiri aims to address these challenges by providing a modern, cloud-based loan management platform that is accessible to lenders of all sizes.

MVP
The minimum viable product (MVP) for Nawiri includes the following features:

Account management for lenders and borrowers
Loan product creation and management
Borrower information and loan balance tracking
Loan payment processing and tracking
Calculation and management of fees and interest charges
Transaction history and reporting
Dispute resolution and issue tracking
Go-to-Market Strategy
Nawiri will initially target small and medium-sized lenders in East Africa, where the lending industry is highly fragmented and there is significant demand for more efficient loan management tools. The platform will be marketed through social media and targeted digital advertising, as well as through partnerships with microfinance institutions and other lenders. Nawiri will also leverage its network of advisors and investors to help promote the platform and build a strong reputation in the industry. As the platform gains traction, Nawiri will expand its offerings to include additional features and capabilities, such as credit scoring and risk management tools.

Technology Stack
Nawiri is built using modern web technologies, including React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. The platform is designed to be scalable and flexible, and can be customized to meet the specific needs of individual lenders.
