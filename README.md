# Pitch Proposal

**ADDING MICROLENDING ABILITIES TO JATMO**

**Member Guaranteed P2P Lending Platform.**

**ESG Goal – Encourage responsible borrowing by members are fair rates.**

1. Concept:
- Goal: Mobilize deposits for use in microlending.

*Problem Statement 1:*

Various Saccos, chamas and investment groups have significant deposits that are utilized for lending and investments. There however exists a problem where the ROI on these investment opportunities are not effectively optimized due to the lack of variety of investment options that yield above market returns at acceptable risk levels.

In addition to this, these organizations lack the necessary adequate controls, structures, and automation to participate in active investments that have better yields due to their ability to react to environmental changes and adjust their investment strategy accordingly.

These institutions are forced to rely on external fund management services and instruments which attract high management costs and less optimal returns due to the need to manage risks via a balanced portfolio.

*Problem Statement 2:*

Members of these institutions often save and contribute their earnings diligently. Their earnings however earn subpar returns due to the risk averse nature of investments these organizations make.

Personally, members of the organizations also face credit needs that are mostly short-term in nature. These are meant to cover immediate transient obligations such as fees and medical costs. At the same time, most have significant savings in Saccos.

Due to the slow and cautious processes in place in many organizations to ensure protection of member contributions as part of fiducial responsibilities, members are often discouraged from accessing savings and are forced to seek short term credit in mobile lending apps, shylocks and payday lenders at punitive interest costs to cover for the high risks of default.

1. Proposal

We propose a new business model that addresses both problem statements by the following:

1. Give opportunities the ability to mobilize their deposits in an innovative, optimized and efficient manner by introducing a new investment option that manages risk effectively and at the same time guarantees high returns.
2. Provide a facility to members and their approved borrowers to access short-term credit at competitive rates.
3. Provide risk management automation and quick and convenient services to all parties through technology.
4. How will we achieve this?
5. Create a microlending payments bridge that allow for disbursements of approved microloans via M-Pesa or bank automatically.
6. Create loan collection module that tracks issued loans as well as follow-ups using SMS and emails and tracks repayments.
7. Loan approval module that check balances against requests using parameters.
8. Loan management tracker that calculates interest applies rollover, controls deposits and liquidity ratios.
9. Membership management – tracks all member statements, guarantors and guarantee scheme, enrollment and recoveries.
10. UI – Mobile App, Web Portal and Admin Page.
11. Risk management and monitoring.
12. Modalities:
13. Loans are made against individual deposits.
14. Loans issued to member and guaranteed borrowers.
15. Loan term not exceeding 45 days.
16. Loan amounts range from KES 1,000 to KES 32,000/-.
17. Limits automatically raised by 80% after successful repayment and 20% increment after rollover.
18. Defaulters are ineligible to borrowers for at least six months.
19. All loans guaranteed by members and risk spread across member pool.
20. Recovery taken after rollover elapses.
21. Recovery Models
- 40% from guaranteed members.
- 60% from bad loans provisions account.
1. Revenue Attribution Model:
    - 40% credited to member account.
    - 60% to capital account.
- Why common pool? Encourages more liquidity and spreads loan default risks.
- Why member guaranteed lending? Encourage initiative and profit motive.
- Why P2P lending? Avoid regulation obligations.
1. Member Obligations:
    - Members act as collection officers and relationship managers.
    - Members can independently suspend, expel and approve members.
    - Members with 2 or more non-performing loans or 3 rollover loans under their portfolio with be warned and put on the amber watch list.
    - Members with 3 defaults concurrently or 5 aggregated defaults in the past 6 months will be suspended from lending. (TBD)
    - Members places on 3 amber lists in the past 3 months will be automatically suspended.
    - Risky borrowers (rollovers and defaulters) reinstated are surcharged at 80% above normal interest for a period of six months (TBD)

# Backup

okay, i am building a microlending app with the codename Nawiri. This app is designed to be used to facilitate guarantor backed loans to borrowers who are known to the guarantor. The solution is aimed at small investment groups and chamas as an alternative channel for investing idle or low return funds by creating a risk managed way which these funds can be lent out at a high interest rate usually between 5% - 8% per month. These loans are short duration usually a month or less. The idea is to build a react native app for borrowers to request loans and channel repayments as well as for guarantors to approve loans and monitor repayment and portfolio health. There is also a Tailwind based react web portal for admins to manage overall fund as well as checking on portfolio health, bad debt provisions and deposit mobilization as well as other admin tasks. The backed will be on node express and mongo db which have the ability to run cron maintenance jobs and reporting as well as alerts.

# Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

Functional requirements for the front-end app:

1. User authentication and registration: Users should be able to create an account and log in to the app.
2. Loan application: Borrowers should be able to apply for a loan by filling out a form that includes information such as loan amount, loan purpose, and contact information.
3. Loan approval: Guarantors should be able to approve or reject loan applications.
4. Repayment tracking: Users should be able to view the status of loan repayments, including due dates, amounts paid, and remaining balance.
5. Portfolio monitoring: Guarantors should be able to view the overall health of their loan portfolio, including information on delinquent loans and bad debt provisions.
6. Mobile-friendly design: The app should be optimized for use on mobile devices, with a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
7. Clear and easy-to-use interface: The app should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with a simple and clean design.

Non-functional requirements for the front-end app:

1. Security: The app should have robust security measures in place to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access.
2. Performance: The app should load quickly and respond quickly to user interactions.
3. Scalability: The app should be able to handle an increasing number of users and transactions without compromising performance.
4. Accessibility: The app should be accessible to users with disabilities and conform to W3C's web accessibility standards.
5. Cross-browser compatibility: The app should work correctly on different web browsers and different versions of those browsers.
6. Localization: The app should be localized to different languages and regions, to reach a wider audience.
7. Compliance: The app should comply with any relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards.

It's worth mentioning that it is important to have a clear and detailed requirements documentation, to help ensure that the front-end app meets the needs of users, it's also important to have a user testing and validation phase to ensure that the app is easy to use and meets the needs of the intended users.

# Risk Management

Risk management is a crucial aspect of any lending operation, and it's important for the Nawiri app to have effective strategies in place to mitigate potential risks. Here are a few risk management strategies that the Nawiri app can employ:

1. Credit risk management: This involves assessing the creditworthiness of borrowers and setting appropriate loan terms and interest rates to minimize the risk of default. Nawiri can use credit scoring and financial analysis to determine a borrower's creditworthiness and set interest rates accordingly.
2. Collateral management: This involves requiring borrowers to provide collateral in the form of assets such as property or equipment to secure a loan. This can help reduce the risk of default, as the lender can seize the collateral in the event of a default.
3. Fraud detection and prevention: This involves implementing measures to detect and prevent fraud, such as identity verification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting.
4. Portfolio diversification: This involves spreading out loans across a variety of borrowers and loan types to reduce the risk of loss. By diversifying the loan portfolio, Nawiri can limit the impact of defaults by any one borrower on the overall portfolio.
5. Risk-based pricing: This involves setting interest rates based on the risk profile of the borrower. Higher-risk borrowers will be charged higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.
6. Reserving for bad debts: This involves setting aside funds to cover potential loan defaults, which can help ensure that the lender can continue to operate even if a number of loans default.
7. Continuous monitoring and review: This involves regularly monitoring the loan portfolio and borrower performance, and taking appropriate action if any issues arise.

It's also important to note that Nawiri can make use of external credit reporting agencies and credit bureaus to access more information on the potential borrowers credit history and make more informed lending decisions.

It's essential to have a clear risk management strategy in place to mitigate potential risks and ensure the sustainability of the lending operation.

A deposit-backed peer-to-peer mobile lending app built in React Native would allow users to lend and borrow money from each other, with the added security of a deposit being held as collateral. To build such an app, you would need to consider the following steps:

1. Determine the target audience and business model for the app. Will the app be focused on personal loans between friends and family, or will it be open to anyone looking to lend or borrow money?
2. Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily browse available loans and make loan requests. This could include features such as a search function, a loan request form, and a messaging system for communication between lenders and borrowers.
3. Implement a deposit system that holds a portion of the loan amount as collateral. This could involve integrating with a payment gateway or other financial services provider to facilitate the transfer of funds.
4. Develop a system for evaluating and approving loan requests, including checks for creditworthiness and other risk factors. This could involve integration with credit bureau data or other sources of financial information.
5. Implement a repayment system that allows borrowers to make payments on their loans and tracks the status of each loan. This could include features such as automatic payment reminders and a system for tracking late payments.
6. Consider implementing additional features, such as a rating system for lenders and borrowers, to help build trust and transparency within the app.

Overall, building a deposit-backed peer-to-peer mobile lending app in React Native will require a combination of design and development skills, as well as a thorough understanding of financial and regulatory issues related to lending.
